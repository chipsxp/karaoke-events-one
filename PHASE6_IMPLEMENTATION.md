## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```typescript
// Enhanced User Model
{
  role: 'KJ' | 'KS' | 'Promoter',
  verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected',
  equipment: string[],
  experience: string,
  vocalRange?: string,
  preferredGenres?: string[]
}

// Enhanced Event Model
{
  capacity: number,
  registrationDeadline: Date,
  autoApprove: boolean,
  equipment: string[],
  songList: string[]
}
```

### Server Actions
- `submitKJVerification()` - KJ verification submission
- `approveKJVerification()` - Admin approval workflow
- `getEventRegistrationsWithDetails()` - Registration management
- `getEventRegistrationStats()` - Analytics and insights

### Validation Schema (`validator.ts`)
```typescript
// KJ Verification
const kjVerificationSchema = z.object({
  experience: z.string().min(50, "Describe your karaoke hosting experience"),
  equipment: z.array(z.string()).min(3, "Add at least 3 equipment items"),
  genres: z.array(z.string()).min(2, "Select at least 2 preferred genres")
});

// Event Creation
const eventSchema = z.object({
  capacity: z.number().min(1).max(1000),
  registrationDeadline: z.date().min(new Date()),
  equipment: z.array(z.string()).min(1, "Add at least 1 equipment item")
});
```
