# Karaoke Events Platform - Enterprise-Grade Architecture Documentation

## Executive Summary

The Karaoke Events Platform represents a sophisticated, production-ready event management system specifically engineered for the karaoke entertainment industry. Built with cutting-edge web technologies and enterprise-grade architecture patterns, this platform seamlessly connects karaoke hosts (KJs), promoters, and singers (KS) through a unified digital ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack Philosophy
Our architecture follows a **modular monolith** approach with Next.js 14's App Router, providing the scalability benefits of microservices while maintaining the simplicity and performance of a monolithic deployment. This decision optimizes for rapid development cycles without compromising long-term scalability.

## üöÄ Frontend Architecture

### Framework & Runtime
- **Next.js 14.2.x** with App Router

### Styling & Design System
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.x** with custom design tokens
- **Radix UI Primitives** for accessible components
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts
- **Custom CSS animations** with performance optimizations

### State Management Architecture
- **Server Actions** for data mutations (Next.js 14)
- **React Server Components** for server-side rendering
- **Client-side state** with React hooks for UI interactions

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture

### MongoDB Schema Design
Our MongoDB implementation follows **domain-driven design** principles with carefully crafted schemas optimized for karaoke-specific use cases:

#### Core Collections
```typescript
// User Management
- users: Clerk-extended user profiles with role-based permissions
- roles: ["KJ", "Promoter", "KS"] with granular permissions

// Event Management
- events: Comprehensive event documents with embedded references
- categories: Hierarchical event categorization
- registrations: Event participation tracking with status workflows

// Financial Operations
- orders: Stripe payment integration with webhook handling
- transactions: Audit trail for all financial operations

// Social Features
- ratings: Multi-dimensional rating system for events and hosts
- notifications: Real-time user engagement system
```

### Database Optimization Strategies

- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with custom claims
- **Session management** with secure JWT tokens
- **Webhook synchronization** for user profile updates
- **Protected route middleware** with granular permissions

### Security Implementation
- **Input sanitization** at every layer
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with React's built-in escaping
- **CSRF protection** with double-submit cookies
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints
- **File upload security** through UploadThing validation

## üí≥ Payment Processing Architecture

### Stripe Integration Design
- **Payment Intents API** for secure payment processing
- **Webhook handling** for asynchronous events
- **Subscription management** for recurring events
- **Refund processing** with automated notifications
- **PCI compliance** through Stripe Elements

### Financial Data Flow
```

```

## üì± Responsive Design System

### Mobile-First Architecture
- **Breakpoints**: xs (390px), sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- **Touch-optimized** interactions with 44px minimum touch targets
- **Progressive enhancement** for device capabilities
- **Performance budgets** for mobile networks

### Component Architecture
