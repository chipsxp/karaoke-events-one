# Karaoke Events Platform - Implementation Summary
## Date: August 5, 2025

## Status: Role Selection Flow Implemented (500 Error Pending Investigation)

## Problem Solved: Blank Page on Create Event

### Original Issue
- **Error**: `⨯ Error: {}` in `lib/utils.ts` at `handleError` function
- **Root Cause**: Users signing up via Clerk weren't assigned roles immediately, causing `getUserById` to throw "User not found" errors
- **Impact**: Create Event page showed blank screen instead of handling missing users gracefully

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Forced Role Selection Flow**
**Files Modified:**
- `app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` - Redirects to `/role-selection` after sign-up
- `app/(auth)/role-selection/page.tsx` - New page for role selection
- `app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Updated deprecated Clerk props

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Redirected to dashboard
redirectUrl="/dashboard" 
afterSignUpUrl="/dashboard"

// After: Redirects to role selection
forceRedirectUrl="/role-selection"
```

#### 2. **Enhanced User Creation**
**Files Modified:**
- `components/toptemp/RoleSelection.tsx` - Updated to create users with roles
- `app/(root)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added role validation and fallback handling

**Key Changes:**
- RoleSelection component now uses `createUser` with proper parameters
- Includes `photo` from Clerk's `user.imageUrl`
- Handles both new user creation and existing user role updates
- Added fallback user creation in dashboard for edge cases

#### 3. **Type Safety Fixes**
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/utils.ts` - Restored original `handleError` behavior
- `lib/actions/user.actions.ts` - Reverted `getUserById` to throw errors (handled by flow)

## Current Architecture Flow

### New User Journey
```
Sign Up → Role Selection → User Creation → Dashboard → Create Event (if KJ)
```

### Existing User Journey
```
Sign In → Dashboard → Create Event (if KJ)
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `app/(auth)/role-selection/page.tsx` - Role selection page
2. Directory: `app/(auth)/role-selection/` - New route structure

### Modified Files
1. `app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` - Updated redirect flow
2. `app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Fixed deprecated props
3. `app/(root)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Enhanced role validation
4. `app/(root)/events/create/page.tsx` - Simplified (role selection handles prerequisites)
5. `components/toptemp/RoleSelection.tsx` - Updated for user creation
6. `lib/utils.ts` - Restored original error handling
7. `lib/actions/user.actions.ts` - Reverted getUserById behavior

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### Immediate Issues to Address
1. **500 Error on Role Selection** - Investigate server-side error
2. **Test the complete flow** from sign-up to create event
3. **Verify database user creation** with role assignment

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] New user sign-up flow
- [ ] Role selection functionality
- [ ] User creation in database
- [ ] Dashboard redirection based on role
- [ ] Create Event page accessibility for KJ users
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases

### Potential Investigation Areas
1. **Database connection** during user creation
2. **Clerk webhook configuration** (if applicable)
3. **Server-side rendering** issues in role selection
4. **Type mismatches** in user creation parameters

## Technical Notes

### Required Parameters for User Creation
```typescript
interface CreateUserParams {
  clerkId: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  photo: string; // From user.imageUrl
  role: 'KJ' | 'Promoter' | 'KS';
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- **KJ**: Can create events, manage registrations, host events
- **KS**: Can browse events, register to sing, track performances
- **Promoter**: Future implementation for event promotion

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Role Selection**: Handles both new user creation and existing user role updates
- **Dashboard**: Fallback user creation for edge cases
- **Create Event**: Clean role validation without complex error handling

## Known Working Components
- ✅ Sign-up/sign-in flow with Clerk
- ✅ Role selection UI and component structure
- ✅ User creation parameters (with photo from Clerk)
- ✅ Dashboard role-based rendering
- ✅ Type safety throughout the flow

## Pending Verification
- ❌ 500 error on role selection page (server-side)
- ❌ Complete end-to-end user journey
- ❌ Database user record creation
- ❌ Role assignment persistence

---

**Next Action**: Investigate 500 error on role selection page and test complete flow.
**Priority**: High - This is blocking the new user onboarding flow.
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes for debugging and testing.
